# Grass is Greener
## Helping you grow a greener lawn
by David Larsen

### Overview
IN DEVELOPMENT

Grass is Greener is designed for personal use for individuals who want to keep better track of their lawn care. It will assist users in not only tracking their lawn care chores as they perform them, but also of helping users know when it is time to complete those tasks. It will also utilize weather API data to remind and alert users of tasks they may not know are needed to maintain a healthy lawn. The integrated weather data will help make this app a “one-stop shop” for lawn hobbyists, providing weather and forecast data to assist with planning lawn care chores.
